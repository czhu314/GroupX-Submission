An application to help students reconnect in a blended learning environment.
A project to help students connect with their peers during online and blended learning, promoting student community through the gamification of engagement.

This application is structured as a forum, allowing students to engage in discussions with their peers and a way to incentivise students to go to lectures and participate in the community by providing points that will contribute to a leaderboard placement.

User Guide
Landing Page
The landing page will be displayed when you either first load the website, or your session gets timed out.

From here you have two options, if you have not yet created an account, the "Create An Account" button will take you to a registration page. On this page you can must enter your email address (identifier), full name and password. You can also select whether you are a staff or student using the checkboxes (if you are a staff you would need to enter the staff code). Finally, you would need to read and accept the terms of service, then create an account

If you do have an account, you can login by pressing the "Login" button and entering the email and password you used to register

Home Page
Once you are logged in, the home page should welcome you by name while a video of exeter plays in the background. You can either click on the "Exeter Website" button to visit the "https://www.exeter.ac.uk/" website, or alternatively, you could click one of the 5 buttons in the top-right corner to navigate to different places within the application:

Profile
Forum
Events
Get Points
Logout
Profile
Clicking the "profile" button will display your profile. This should contain your name, a profile picture, current rankings, social media hyperlinks and a button to change your settings. Upon clicking the "Change Settings" button, it will give you the option to edit your name, profile picture, display/hide your streaks and treasure hunt points and link your social media. Clicking "Submit Changes" will confirm these changes and "Cancel" will cancel the changes and redirect you back to your profile.

Forum
The Forum is a place where other students can create topics and host discussions, allowing students to stay connected online. Within a forum, you can click "New Post" to create a new post, or view all the current posts and comment/reply to these. Clicking "View Post and Replies" will open the thread, displaying the main title, and all the replies in reverse order. One can also post a reply to any thread by simply viewing it, then typing a message in the "Post a Reply" box.

From the forum, you can also click the user's name which will display their profile, allowing you to see their profile picture, social media links and leaderboard rankings (if they have made them public or added them!)

Events
The events page will show a list of all the events which are currently being hosted around either online or around campus. These events have been split into 4 categories (Socail, Special, Outdoor and Limited).

By clicking the "Event Maps" button, you will be taken to an interactive map which will display all of the events around campus allowing you to easily see any interesting events in your area. On the map, we can also see blue numbered circles, which represent the clues for a treasure hunt event. This is an in-person event which we believe will help the students reintegrate onto campus and do so in a fun way which can gain them points (moving them up the leaderboard).

Get Points
Whenever a lecturer or society leader gives out a points code (say for lecturers or extra-curricular activites), you can enter that code on this tab. This will not only go towards your total points, but also the leaderboard related to that subject (For example, points related to computer science will also put you on the "computer science leaderboard").
